🧮 I'm **GaloisField**, [@Blockcryptology](https://twitter.com/Blockcryptology), 📩 galoisfield2718@gmail.com.

🏆 I won 2️⃣ Blockchain hackathon at Brussels with [ResearchDAO](https://github.com/fulmini/ResearchDAO) and [TweetX](https://github.com/tweetnfts/TweetX).

🤝 Very involved in the **Bitcoin** community as in the **Blockchain space**.

🧰 I built some tools as [Telegram Converter Bot](https://github.com/GaloisField2718/SatoshiPriceBot), [Email saver for Bitcoin-dev Digest](https://github.com/GaloisField2718/Bitcoin-dev-digest) and few other you can find on my profile.

🧑‍💻 Every hackathon has its own repository and I try to specify them in the description 💬. Feel free to check some of them and fork it 🍴 as you need.

🧑‍🎓 Actual student in Master Computer Sciences, I hope to shape tomorrow Blockchain tools. 

📆 Actually mainly involved with new protocols on top of Bitcoin and projects on top of them : [Ordinals](github.com/ordinals/ord) and [Atomicals-js](github.com/atomicals/atomicals-js) for example. But I'm making some tests also on [Near Protocol](near.org), their command line is really cool and should be tested [near-cli-rs](https://github.com/near/near-cli-rs)
