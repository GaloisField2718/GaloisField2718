üßÆ I'm **GaloisField**, [@Blockcryptology](https://twitter.com/Blockcryptology), üì© [galoisfield2718@gmail.com](mailto:galoisfield2718@gmail.com?subject=I%20want%20to%20talk%20with%20you%20about...).

üèÜ I won 2Ô∏è‚É£ Brussels Blockchain Hackathon with [ResearchDAO](https://github.com/fulmini/ResearchDAO) and [TweetX](https://github.com/tweetnfts/TweetX).

ü§ù Very involved in the **Bitcoin** community as in the **Blockchain space**. 

I attended to [üëâ](https://b.tc/conference/amsterdam)

üß∞ I built some tools as [Telegram Converter Bot](https://github.com/GaloisField2718/SatoshiPriceBot), [Email saver for Bitcoin-dev Digest](https://github.com/GaloisField2718/Bitcoin-dev-digest) and few other you can find on my profile.

üßë‚Äçüíª Every hackathon has its own repository and I try to specify them in the description üí¨. Feel free to check some of them and fork it üç¥ as you need.

üßë‚Äçüéì Actual student in Master Computer Sciences, I hope to shape tomorrow Blockchain tools. 

üìÜ Actually mainly involved with new protocols on top of Bitcoin and projects on top of them : [Ordinals](github.com/ordinals/ord) and [Atomicals-js](github.com/atomicals/atomicals-js) for example. But I'm making some tests also on [Near Protocol](near.org), their command line is really cool and should be tested [near-cli-rs](https://github.com/near/near-cli-rs)

## Thanks üôè

Unfortunately [Rix AI | Hashnode](https://hasnode.com/rix) which were providing **Claude 2 AI** for free and available everywhere without limitations, is not available anymore... üò¢ I was a big fan, but I will need to take a subscription to ChatGPT üò≠ Or... [janhq/jan: Jan is an open source alternative to ChatGPT that runs 100% offline on your computer](https://github.com/janhq/jan) could be THE SOLUTION with [Mistral AI | Open-weight models](https://mistral.ai/) could do the job üòÑ

Thank you also to [goosinals team](https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/goosinals) for sending me a goosinals version of my pfp \
![Taproot Goosinals](./assets/taproot_goose.jpg). 

And also a BIG THANK YOU for all the community who are thinking, discussing and building on **Bitcoin** and **Blockchain Protocols**. The community is very kind with smart and interesting people. So, big thank you to everyone I have met and I hope to meet in the future ! üòò
